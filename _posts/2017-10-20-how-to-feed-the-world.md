*Note*: Faces of farming all around the world, small farms are playing a big role in feeding the world. These are a few of the men and women behind that effort. PHOTOGRAPHS BY JIM RICHARDSON.

One thing that I loved from participating in any hackathon is that it challenges you to be as creative as you can while solving the problem that you really care about.

Speaking of the thing I really care about, lately, I've been thinking a lot about food security, and how technology (information technology to be specific) can help us to solve this problem.

According to FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations), by 2050 we’ll need to feed two billion more people. Our demands for food will increase by 70%.

Meanwhile, farmers throughout the world struggle to prevent and eradicate various diseases from their crops. It’s estimated that various pests (insects, weeds, nematodes, animals, diseases) each year cause crop yield losses of 20-40%. More precisely, there is some data that maintains that crop diseases cause average yield losses of 42% for the most important food crops. In some cases, crop diseases destroy the whole crop production.

**This is ridiculous**. We can't afford to lose any food when we need more of it.

For this reason, it's extremely important for farmers to find out all they can about the crop diseases so they can manage them properly. The rapid, accurate diagnosis of disease and its management will help to reduce yield losses. But, the infrastructure for crop disease diagnostic is limited.

One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning.

It's widely predicted that by 2020, there will be about 5 billion smartphones distributed across farmers around the world. Offering the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food.

That's why in this hackathon we built a chatbot to help farmers diagnose crop disease called Dr. Tania. Dr. Tania is a deep learning based chatbot that could identify crop diseases through image recognition. She can also tell the farmer about symptoms, and how to manage the disease correctly and effectively.

Dr. Tania in action:

We know that what we built is far from perfect, but the approach of training deep learning models on increasingly large and publicly available image datasets presents a clear path toward smartphone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a massive global scale.
