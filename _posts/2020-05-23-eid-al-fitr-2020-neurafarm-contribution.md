Hi, I hope you are well.

Different sectors of the economy have been hit in different ways by the COVID-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, with travel at a minimum and social lives put on hold, the accommodation and food services industries are among those suffering most, along with manufacturing, wholesale and retail. The global workforce are affected. Not only does COVID-19 affect the formal workers, many informal workers have been hit hard as well.

Indonesia has the largest economy in Southeast Asia. As with other developing countries in Asia-Pacific, more than half its workers are in the informal sector, including farmers. More than 100 million of Indonesian are employed in the Agriculture sector, and some 250+ million are depending on this very sector on daily basis to fulfill the demand for food. it should be one of our top priorities to support the industry to ensure food security.

There are millions of farmers in Indonesia, and the majority of them have been impacted the recent situation. A lot of hotels, restaurant, and cafe are closing down, and people lose their purchasing power, making it hard for farmers to sell their crops. 

In the past three months, [Neurafarm](www.neurafarm.com) has put a lot of effort to empowering farmers to keep them productive during the crisis. If there's one thing that we all learned about this situation, it's about how fragile our lives and our systems are. Coronavirus is exposing the world's fragile food system. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly disrupting the global food supply at nearly every level. Those problems, and the economic destruction caused by the virus, could have a devastating impact on the ability of people across the world to access and afford food. It is in the time like this that we've finally got the chance to reflect and rethink how we grow our food.

We've done something to support our farmers but it's just the beginning.

After months of constant support for farmers, now it's time to take care of ourselves for a while, spend a little more time with family. [Neurafarm](www.neurafarm.com) team will take a break for a week due to Eid Al-Fitr. We still open free online consultation for farmers albeit only for a couple hours per day. [Neurafarm](www.neurafarm.com) hopes that you'll stay healthy and we wish you a happy Eid Al-Fitr!

We hope that we could come back all fresh, and ready to serve more.

## Aksi Sayur donation for farmers and the local community

Not only Free Online Class, in the second event, we've also held a fundraiser to support "Aksi Sayur" or "Vegetables Movement" by Mr. Karya (Farmer in Lembang), that is, collecting produce from local farmers and give it all away to the ones in need. The donations were distributed in the form of fresh vegetables packages that consist of tomato, carrot, cabbage, rice, etc each.

74 fresh vegetables packages were distributed. Thank you for your contribution, now 74 people/family can eat fresh vegetables during Eid Al-Fitr while celebrating with their families. By contributing, not only have you helped them, you've also helped 26 farmers who have been involved in this movement.

We believe that a small act of kindess could create a big impact. I hope it could create a ripple effect.

## What's next?

This pandemic has change a lot of things. Including they way we work, play, and communicate. During this unprecedented situation, various new things have emerged: the so called new normal, new habit, new experiences, new insights, and of course, new problems. But we believe that along with problemw, there lie opportunies. Opportunity to reflect and rethink everything, including how could we fulfill our demand for food. For the more resilient food system. 

Still with the same goals, and mission. We'll continue to strive for a sustainable agriculture, where we could fulfill our demand for food without compromising our generation.
