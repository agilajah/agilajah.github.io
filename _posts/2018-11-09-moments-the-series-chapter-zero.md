The year was 2080. It was the day of the winter solstice, which means it was the shortest day of the year for the Northern Hemisphere. That day, New York City only experienced 9 hours and 15 minutes of sunlight. Although, it was still better than what people in Helsinki, Finland were facing: only 5 hours and 49 minutes of light. Alas, it wasn't the worst of all, to say the least. There was this place called Barrow in Alaska where its people hadn't even had a sunrise at all since mid-November.   

The world might look pretty grim now. However, not everyone felt depressed because of it. Some were happy like they did. After all, from now on, the days began to grow longer again. Not only that. In fact, there are more known rituals and celebrations associated with this moment than for any other time of the year. Every year, people celebrate the winter solstice in various forms. Hundreds of years ago, Romans called this day Dies Natalis Invicti Solis, the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun. And today, revellers gathered in Stonehenge to watch the sunrise on the shortest day. In Seattle, you could even celebrate at the Feast of the Winter Solstice by registering to join the Fremont Arts Council.

But this would not stop some people to associate the solstice with something dark and evil, or even cataclysmic events. The winter solstice of 2012 was a perfect example. Some actually believed that it could be the end of the world. But none of that happened. Apparently, they were convinced because 21 December 2012 corresponded to the date 13.0.0.0.0 in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar used by the ancient Mayans, marking the end of a 5126-year cycle. In reality, lots of these people were died because of anything but doomsday. Some of them were even still alive today, enjoying another winter solstice, thanks to the advancement of anti-ageing technology. Now, they would certainly laugh their ass off if they remember how stupid they were for believing such an absurd prophecy. 

Not everyone felt depressed because of the winter solstice. Some of them were happy like they did. Every year, people celebrate the winter solstice in various forms.

But Ethan White wasn't one of them. Feast and celebration weren't for someone like him, whose everything been taken away for good in the winter solstice. When others could only imagine and feared this juncture would bring about the end of the world, it was literally the end of the world for him.

Ethan sat on an antique wooden chair in a big white room of a house in the centre of New York City, looking out at Mount Marcy. In the next 5 minutes, he would be staring at the Tunnel View, the iconic vista of towering Bridalveil Fall and the granite cliffs of El Capitan and Half Dome in Yosemite National Park from the exact same windows. All of which had nearly gone, replaced by something entirely new and synthetic. 

It had been 30 minutes since he entered the room. He had seen everything--from the beautiful scenery of Tuvalu to the breathtaking landscape of The Alps. Which also had disappeared some 20 years ago. Many people had loved the place, but none of them could protect it from Global Warming. Luckily, they took a lot of pictures of those places and someone invented LED displays in transparent glass so people could display anything on their window glass with high quality. At least, they could see the scenery at the windows and reminiscing. 

â€œSorry, I'm late." woman's voice broke the silence as she waltzed into the room and sat on an identical antique chair across to Ethan.
