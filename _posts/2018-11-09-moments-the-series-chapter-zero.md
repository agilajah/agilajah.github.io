The year was 2060. It was the day of the winter solstice, which means it was the shortest day of the year for the Northern Hemisphere. That day, New York City only experienced 9 hours and 15 minutes of sunlight. Although, it was still better than what people in Helsinki, Finland were facing: only 5 hours and 49 minutes of light. Alas, there was this place called Barrow in Alaska where its people hadn't had a sunrise at all since mid-November.   

The world might look pretty grim now. However, not everyone felt depressed because of the winter solstice. Some were happy like they did. After all, from now on, the days began to grow longer again. Not only that. In fact, there are more known rituals and celebrations associated with this moment than for any other time of the year. Every year, people celebrate the winter solstice in various forms. Hundreds of years ago, Romans called this day Dies Natalis Invicti Solis, the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun. And today, revellers gathered in Stonehenge to watch the sunrise on the shortest day. In Seattle, you could even celebrate at the Feast of the Winter Solstice by registering to join the Fremont Arts Council.

But this would not stop some people to associate the solstice with something dark like cataclysmic events. Lots of people who lived on earth today once had actually believed that the winter solstice of 2012 could be the end of the world. Because 21 December 2012 corresponded to the date 13.0.0.0.0 in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar used by the ancient Mayans, marking the end of a 5126-year cycle. Now, they would laugh their ass off if they remember how stupid they were to believe such an absurd prediction. 

Not everyone felt depressed because of the winter solstice. Some of them were happy like they did. Every year, people celebrate the winter solstice in various forms.

And Ethan White wasn't one of them. Feast and celebration weren't for someone like Ethan White, whose everything important to him had been taken away for good in the winter solstice. When others could only imagine and feared this juncture would bring about the end of the world, it was literally the end of the world for Ethan.
