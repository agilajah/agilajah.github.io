{: style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"}
An engineer, designer, storyteller, and aspiring entrepreneur. Currently a final year student of [Bandung Institute of Technology's][1] School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, majoring Informatics/Computer Science. 

As a passionately curious person, I keep trying things and keep learning. I'd love to blazing my own trails and taking on whatever project is most fascinating. So long as I get to use my people skills, identify and achieve my own goals and inspire my colleagues and followers, I will be happy.

I always believe in the concept of intrinsic motivation, the idea that things are worth doing for my own sake, not because of some convoluted system of punishments and rewards.

Astrophysics, Machine Learning, Design, and all the things related to AI and computer are my interests.
