I am a third year student at [Bandung Institute of Technology's][1] School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, and majoring Informatics/Computer Science.

I am passionately curious, vowed that I'd live and I'd learn. Knowing very well about what I want, I am going to keep trying things and keep learning to pursue my mission, and I take responsibility for everything that has happened to me up to this point.

I always believe in the concept of intrinsic motivation, the idea that things are worth doing for my own sake, not because of some convoluted system of punishments and rewards.

I'd love to blazing my own trails and taking on whatever project is most fascinating. So long as I get to use my people skills, identify and achieve my own goals and inspire my colleagues and followers, I will be happy.

Astrophysics, Machine Learning, Design, and all the things related to AI and computer are my interests.
