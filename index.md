{: style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom: 0;"}

I am investing in the future, forging a legacy that endures, and trying to leave the world better than I found it.

An engineer, designer, storyteller, and aspiring entrepreneur; **In a mission to provide value to masses with something I created**. Currently focusing my attention on [developing technology to help farmers feed everyone on the planet](http://neurafarm.com/). I studied under full scholarship from Indonesia's Government majoring in Computer Science/Informatics at [Bandung Institute of Technology's][1] School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics. I am also Co-Founder, CEO & CTO of [Neurafarm](http://neurafarm.com/) where I drive innovation strategy for the company and ensures technology excellence as part of Neurafarm's commitment to provide and democratize farming technology to help farmers feed the world.

As a passionately curious person, I keep trying things and keep learning. I'd love to blazing my own trails and taking on whatever project is most fascinating. So long as I get to use my people skills, identify and achieve my own goals and inspire my colleagues and followers, I will be happy.

I always believe in the concept of intrinsic motivation, the idea that things are worth doing for my own sake, not because of some convoluted system of punishments and rewards.

I play video games like it's my life. I watch movies like I got nothing else to do. I love reading too much, I can't say no. That's why sometimes I'd abandon my old books for a new one. Astrophysics, Design, Investment, and AI/Computer related things are my interests.
