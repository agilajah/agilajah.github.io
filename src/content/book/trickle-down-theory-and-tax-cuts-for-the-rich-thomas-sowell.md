title: "'Trickle Down Theory' and 'Tax Cuts for the Rich'"
author: "Thomas Sowell"
description: "Thomas Sowell rejects the term 'trickle-down theory' as a mischaracterization of supply-side economics, which he supports.  He argues that tax cuts, even for the wealthy, stimulate investment and job creation, ultimately benefiting the entire economy through increased production and demand, not by a deliberate 'trickling down' of wealth."
