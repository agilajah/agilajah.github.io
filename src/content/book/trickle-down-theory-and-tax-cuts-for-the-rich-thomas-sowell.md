title: "'Trickle Down Theory' and 'Tax Cuts for the Rich'"
author: "Thomas Sowell"
description: "Thomas Sowell rejects the term “trickle-down theory” as a mischaracterization of supply-side economics, which he supports.  He argues that tax cuts, even for the wealthy, stimulate investment and job creation, ultimately benefiting the entire economy through increased production and demand, not by a deliberate “trickling down” of wealth.  He prioritizes wealth creation over redistribution, emphasizing the importance of incentives and free markets, and believing that lower tax rates, while potentially benefiting high earners initially, ultimately lead to broader economic growth and higher overall tax revenue.  He is critical of progressive taxation and advocates for a limited government role in the economy."
