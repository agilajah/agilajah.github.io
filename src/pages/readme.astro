		<h1 class="title">About</h1>
		<p>
			Hi, Iâ€™m Febi.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am from Indonesia. I am a first-generation college student (graduated)--first in my family to attend college, studied Computer Science/Informatics at Bandung Institute of Technology with a full scholarship from the Indonesian government. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I aspire to become an entrepreneur and make an impact with something I help create. 
			In high school, I ran a clothing 'business' with my friends, and in college, started my "career" as a freelancer programmer providing solutions for a university, telco company, oil & gas company, and SMEs. Basically writing code for most of my life.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am very competitive - that's why I joined many hackathons and competitions: gratefully won some, and lost more than I can count--such valuable learnings.  
			All in all, I learned many things along the way and met amazing people. 	
		</p>
		<h1 class="title">What do I do?</h1>
		<p>
			I am a product builder at heart.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be it building solutions from well-defined problem statements the likes of in competitions, hackathons, and projects all the way to discovering problems and crafting solutions from ground up with lots of uncertainty in startups settings.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's a quote that best paint a picture of me:
		</p>

			<p>"I stay up all night disassembling the world, so that I can put it back together with new features."
			</p>

		</blockquote>
		<p>
			My passion for building tech products, and aspiration to create long lasting, impactful businesses have led me to build a startup called Neurafarm in my final year in college.
			I helped build a small team and the product from the scratch as CTO, and later on focused on strategy, business, innovation, and making sure the company is well-funded, as part of my role as the CEO until 2022.
		</p>
		<p>
			My time there was amazing and full of challenges: deploying human-centric digital solutions to tens of thousands of smallholder farmers, and built an AI & data-enabled ecosystem to improve overall farmers' productivity, while marching many stakeholders to support our mission. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Now I continue to working on the same vision and mission at Elevarm to Elevate Farmers, as CTO, where I lead team of engineers and manage portfolio of products that enable data-driven agriculture ecosystem.
		</p>
		<p>
			I really enjoy working on complex strategic problems involving software engineering, design, and machine learning, especially in high-impact and multidimensional fields like agriculture and healthcare.
		</p>

		<p>
			I love to talk to people about technology, predicting the future, analysing trend, and social impact.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest advancements in technology, immerse myself in astrophysics, and experimenting with new ideas.
