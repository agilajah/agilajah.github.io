Basically this theme was inspired by [sylvaindurand.org](http://sylvaindurand.org), built with *Jekyll*. The design is brilliant and simple, but I tried to add some features like comment and share, and tweak some components as well.

# Wanna try?

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/agilajah/agilajah.github.io.git`
2. Open the folder: `cd agilajah.github.io`
3. Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Build the website: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Look at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000): surprise!

# Colophon
This website is entirely [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page): it works only with HTML and CSS, and does not use any dynamic language or any javascript code. Each page requires only one request! Particular attention is paid to [typography](http://webtypography.net/) and to [vertical motion](http://webtypography.net/2.2.2).

The pages are produced with the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The website is then hosted and served thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Each page header is illustrated with a part from the ["Turgot" map of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgot_map_of_Paris), created in the 18<sup>th</sup> century by Louis Bretez.
